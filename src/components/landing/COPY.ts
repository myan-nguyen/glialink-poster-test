  // Problem
  problemHeading: "Research is hard to find, understand, and act on",
  problemP1:
    "You present a poster. Someone interested walks by. You exchange a business card — or you don't. Either way, the conversation ends when the session does. Your work goes back into a PDF folder. The collaboration never happens.",
  problemP2:
    "Meanwhile, your lab website is three years out of date, your ResearchGate profile is buried in spam notifications, and your most recent publication sits behind a paywall that even your colleagues can't access.",
  problemP3:
    "The research ecosystem runs on scattered PDFs, stale websites, and hope. We think there's a better way to share what you're working on — and to find the people who should know about it.",

  card3Body:
    "Print a QR code for your poster session. Share the link on LinkedIn after a publication. Send it in a grant application. Your project page is a living, shareable object.",

  // How It Works
  howHeading: "Three steps. Two minutes.",
  step1:
    "Share a publication, poster, or abstract — or just paste a link to your Google Scholar profile.",
  step2:
    "Glialink generates a structured project page with your work, your intent signals, and a clean shareable link.",
  step3:
    "Share it at your next conference, on social media, or by email. Interested collaborators reach out through the page.",
